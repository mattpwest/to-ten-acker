# Totenacker
Totenacker is a web service for sharing high scores and [bones files](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Save_Files#Bones_Files) from Roguelike games between players. Unlike [Hearse](http://hearse.krollmark.com/) this aims to offer something more generic that can be used by any game, rather than being specifically for Nethack.
